BIO 340 Project: CRISPR knockout of tolC in E. coli and antibiotic sensitivity analysis
# CRISPR Knockout of *tolC* in *E. coli* â€“ BIO 340 Project

This repository contains the full report, data, figures, and code for our BIO 340 project investigating the role of the *tolC* gene in antibiotic resistance in *Escherichia coli* using CRISPR-Cas9.

## ðŸ§ª Project Overview
Antibiotic resistance is a major global health issue. The *tolC* gene encodes an essential outer membrane channel in the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump system, which contributes to bacterial resistance by exporting antibiotics out of the cell.

We hypothesized that a CRISPR-mediated knockout of *tolC* would significantly increase *E. coli* sensitivity to multiple antibiotics.

## ðŸ§¬ Methods Summary
- CRISPR-Cas9 was used to knock out the *tolC* gene in *E. coli* DH5Î±.
- Colony PCR confirmed gene deletion.
- Disk diffusion assays were performed using tetracycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol.
- Growth curves verified that knockout did not affect general viability.
- Analysis was done in Python using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy`.

## ðŸ“ˆ How to Run the Analysis
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
python tolC_knockout_analysis.py
```

This will output:
- `antibiotic_sensitivity_summary.csv`
- `antibiotic_sensitivity_comparison.png`
